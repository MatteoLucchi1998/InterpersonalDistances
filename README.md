# InterpersonalDistances
During the COVID-19 pandemic it is necessary, to prevent contagion, to keep a safe distance from other individuals, in particular in public places. This project was created to provide a tool that, through Neural Networks and Artificial Vision, exploits images collected by surveillance video systems, producing useful information for respecting interpersonal distancing.
